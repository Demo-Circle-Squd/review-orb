# YAML Formatting Rules for yamllint Compliance

## File Formatting

- All YAML files must end with a single newline character
- Remove all trailing whitespace from lines
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for YAML files)
- Maximum line length should not exceed 200 characters

## YAML Syntax Standards

- Use proper YAML syntax and structure
- Ensure consistent spacing around colons and dashes
- Use double quotes for strings containing special characters
- Maintain consistent indentation levels throughout the file

## CircleCI Orb Specific Rules

- Command parameters should be properly typed (string, enum, etc.)
- Include statements must be on their own line without mixing with other commands
- Environment variables should be passed separately from include statements
- All orb components (jobs, commands, executors) must have descriptions

## Code Quality

- Avoid inline comments that break YAML structure
- Use meaningful names for parameters and steps
- Ensure all required parameters have appropriate defaults where applicable

## File Organization

- Keep related configuration grouped together
- Use consistent naming conventions across all YAML files
- Maintain proper file structure following CircleCI orb standards
